# 🎯 INSY7314 - Application Security & MERN Full Stack

## 📖 Overview

Welcome to INSY7314! In this module, you’ll design and build a secure, real-world application from the ground up using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Security is woven into everything you do—from your first commit, to every line of code and every deployment.

### What you can expect:
- Practical coding where we scaffold, code, and secure every feature.
- Activities that don’t just teach you to build, but also to break and defend.
- Frequent repo pushes for ongoing, real-world learning.
- By the end, you’ll be confident building and securing apps that would survive in production.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder will match a project feature, milestone or topic. I will update and add activities, guides, and templates as we go. You’ll be expected to keep your repo organized and .env/node_modules out of version control!

## 😎 What's the reason for this module in BCAD?

You’ve already learned your fair share of code.
This module is here to take it further—into the world of professional app security.

- ⚡ Security is not just a bonus skill, it’s what makes you employable (and stops you from accidentally leaking everyone’s data).
- 🎯 The threats are real: bot attacks, data breaches, app takeovers. You’ll learn how to defend against all of it, hands-on.

## 🏆 How will the module be taught?
- 🚀 We focus on secure-by-design coding, using VS Code for the entire stack.
- 💡 You will code, break, defend, and reflect. It’s not about “passing”—it’s about building the skillset every company wants.
- 💻 Repo pushes are required.

## 🛠 How does ICE work?
My ICE are simple, submit any four apps we built in class. At some point, I will give you GitHub Classroom links to claim repos which you will push to.  

❌ No submission, empty repo, wrong language, or blank submission = 0.
